# Template

This is a template for an example repository.

You can create a new example by simply clicking on "Use this template".

The included example is showing the generation of a conditioned random field ensemble
in 1D taken from [GSTools](https://geostat-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/gstools/en/stable/examples/06_conditioned_fields/00_condition_ensemble.html#sphx-glr-examples-06-conditioned-fields-00-condition-ensemble-py).


## Structure

Please organize your example in the given Structure
- `data/`: here you should place your input data
- `src/`: here you should place your python scripts
- `results/`: here your computed results and plots should be stored
- `README.md`: please describe your example in the readme, potentially showing results


## Python environment

To make the example reproducible, it would be a good practice to provide one of
the following files:
- `requirements.txt` requirements for [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) to install all needed packages
- `spec-file.txt` specification file to create the original [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments)


## Workflow

After finalizing your work, you should tag the repository with a version like `v1.0`.

Then, a [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) release will be created, so you can cite the repository in you publication.
